# Email Classifier using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for classifying emails into categories (such as spam or non-spam) using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of emails and uses features such as email content, subject line, and metadata for classification.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a public email dataset, which contains labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails. 

- Email Dataset: [[link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/spam-email-classification)]

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository and interact with the Streamlit app, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
- nltk (for natural language processing)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit nltk
```

## Usage
To train the email classifier model and deploy a Streamlit app for users to interact with the trained model, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Preprocess the data and train the model using the Jupyter notebook `email_classifier_training.ipynb`.
4. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
5. Open your web browser and go to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501) to access the user interface.
6. Input the email text in the provided text box and click the 'Classify' button to see the model's classification (e.g., spam or non-spam).

## Streamlit App
The Streamlit app (`app.py`) included in this repository provides a simple interface for users to input email text and receive predictions from the trained machine learning model.

## Model Training
The model training script (`email_classifier_training.ipynb`) includes the following steps:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Extract features from the email text using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) on the extracted features.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
